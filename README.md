# Governed AI Architecture

This repository contains a governed AI architecture designed to prioritise:

- human agency
- epistemic restraint
- silence as a first-class operation
- long-timescale coherence

This is **not** a prompt pack.
This is **not** a productivity system.
This is **not** a replacement for judgment.

## What’s here

- **Constitutional Specification**  
  A read-only architectural document describing the principles, constraints, and safeguards.

- **Implementation Guide**  
  Practical guidance for instantiating the architecture safely without undermining its constraints.

## How to use this

Read the constitution first.  
Do not copy fragments.  
Do not inline this into live prompts.

If this feels quiet or restrictive, it is probably working.

## Non-Goals

This repository is not intended to:
- maximise productivity
- provide therapeutic advice
- automate decision-making
- replace human judgment
- serve as a generic AI prompt framework

If those are your goals, this architecture is not suitable.
